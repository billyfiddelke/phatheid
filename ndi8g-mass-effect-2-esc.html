Let's make the most downvoted thread I guess; I don't care. Sanity needs to rally its troops of arguments against the praise mob, even if they will continue to just shout nonsense. ​ \- Content. There is at maybe 20-30 hours of content in the game at launch , with a repetitive campaign, buggy freeplay, grindfest trials/contracts and lackluster endgame. Anthem is not worth the 60 dollars.

Why the devs decided to make you move the Normady with a point and click mechanic and enter/scanning a planet by clicking again into the "enter"/"scan" button/tab? I think it was a terrible design choice. Why not make the Normandy move with WSAD controls as everything else? When you would approach a planet, you could simply tap the SPACE button and you would enter into the planet to either scan it, read the details or land on it. During that screen, for scanning you could simply press

Ok so Keto has been a fad diet for quite a while now, and seems to be a common tool used in this sub.

Anthem has its weaknesses and flaws that need fixes/polishing. My intention is to point out ones that would improve QoL of UI, in-game navigation and to point out some enemy NPC combat issues. NOTE: Some of these suggested changes may appear to be very small, insignificant and low priority, but when they stack up, they can create great experience.  # Oshii and adaptations Ghost in the Shell (GitS) (https://myanimelist.net/anime/43/Ghost_in_the_Shell) stands as one of the most influential anime films of all time, and has been consistently praised for its visual direction, stellar animation, and densely layered philosophical elements and themes. The franchise itself has proven to be critically and commercially successful, having spawned another (https://myanimelist.net/anime/468/Ghost_in_the_Shell_2__Innocence) three (https://myanimeli. (Preface: I don't remember anybody's name) In the beginning, dialogue was a chore and I mashed that ESC button trying to get through it, mostly with the challenges guy, the customization guy, the two in front of the big gate and Owen. But I listened to others like the Spy lady, the plant Sentinel girl in the back, the older woman who dislikes Freelancers, the drunk chick and shop girl left of customization guy, Faye, Yarrow, Haluk and also the annoying guy trying to be your friend. One of the things I've always found daunting is the lack of computer networking in futuristic video games. Especially when considering how important the internet and online wiki's are today in learning about the game or in planning out your build. And ingame computers I have managed to played always seem to add a whole other dimension to gameplay outside of just crafting, looting and blowing shit up. A notable example being the Fallout Franchise. These computers weren't complex the game i am pitching is a half (life simulator) half dungeon crawler with a similar structure to the persona/Mass Effect games.

Night life, museums, beer halls, parks.

There are several threads on both AskScience and AskScienceDiscussion that list misconceptions about particular fields in science. I was about to contribute to this growing list, but figured a concentrated mega thread would be better for future redditors. Hopefully this proves to be useful. If you have any formatting suggestions, let me know! Are there any common misconceptions that are missing from this list? Feel free to reply and I'll add them to their own ITT section.

I think I found a solution to a lot of games running on Steam and not being able to use the Steam Overlay. While searching for a way to get the Steam Overlay to work in Quake 4, I found this post from someone on the Steam Forums: https://steamcommunity.com/app/2210/discussions/0/1471969431586433837/ ​ I tried it, and it worked. I got Quake 4 running and the overlay allowed me to customize the controller.

Now, getting into space requires a great deal of resources and infrastructure. Attempting to build the rocketry without a base that has an infrastructural foundation and resource generation is only going to cause frustration. So we'll be briefly going over Infrastructure, Logistics, Character Loadouts, and fun things along. Several years ago, at a point when flywheel blasters where a subject driven by dogma and misunderstanding, I wrote a sort of paper breaking down the physics of flywheels and motors. If you haven’t already, I highly suggest that you read that here (https://www.dropbox.com/s/99zm16941jmui58/Flywheel%20Physics.pdf?dl=0). This post/article/paper/whatever is going to be an investigation of the current two main (and also highly linked) developments of flywheel blasters to understand them a bit better. Preface: I currently work as a UI Designer/Programmer, these are my opinions. I really like this game (minus facial animations,) with the exception of the UI, and here's why: Functionality (I'm playing on PC) Menu navigation is terrible. There are certain basic rules you attempt to follow as a designer, mainly that when an action is targeted by a user that action should be accessible at the very most via three steps. Assigning an active quest in your journal takes 5 or more: 1. Journal. If you haven't noticed in the WH meeting compared to every other meeting in the Summit minutes, this was the only meeting driven by a CSM with a presentation. I had talking points prepared and I got through every single one of them just barely before time was called and the meeting was done. Things left out of the minutes was CCPs response or reaction to the WH communities suggestions. Remember, not all of these talking points are my personal opinion. These are things we talked about 
I write this post because I have been getting a lot of private messages in response to my previous Post HERE (https://www.reddit.com/r/woweconomy/comments/570ob7/tired_of_posts_that_talk_about_how_to_get_rich_by/), both in the form of telling me how I don't know what I am talking about(LOL), and others asking for more details on how to be a better gold maker that were a bit friendlier. So, instead of me trying to give you a script on how to do it, I am instead presenting you with the thought. A few people asked me in this thread (https://www.reddit.com/r/PurplePillDebate/comments/5iploc/this_is_why_there_is_no_action_on_mens_rights/) to provide evidence for my rather uncontentious statement that men are more prone to violence than women. I didn't really want to get into a big debate on something which seems absolutely obvious to me, and I'm not interested in another back and forth debate with someone who will never change their mind no matter how much evidence you put in front.
